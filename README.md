# git_guide
A simple userguide for me as a freshman in git and github
The most simplest steps:
(1) Create a new repository in the github, which has its address "https://github.com/hwygroup/test.git"
(2) In local computer, choose a address, and "git clone https://github.com/hwygroup/test.git"
(3) In the "test" of local computer, "touch test1 test2", which means generate two new files
(4) "git add test1 test2" and "git commit -m 'add two files'", which means adding these two files to local repository
(5) "git remote add hwygroup https://github.com/hwygroup/test.git"
(6) "git push hwygroup master"
(7) The above two steps are submit to the remote github address (we have named it as hwygroup)
